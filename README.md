## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/alquilando.git
    cd alquilando
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Initialize the database:**
    ```bash
    # Assuming you have a script or Flask command for this
    flask init-db
    ```
5.  **Run the application:**

    To run the application, navigate to the root directory of the project (`C:\Facultad_Informatica\Proyecto_Inmobiliario`) and execute:
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```
    If Flask is not globally installed, ensure you activate the virtual environment first. From the `alquilando` directory:
    ```bash
    cd alquilando
    .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    # source venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux
    cd ..
    python run.py
    ```
